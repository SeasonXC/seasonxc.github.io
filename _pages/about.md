# Case File: Mathematical Investigations

> **Motto.** *The game is afoot — in equations.*  
> I treat research like detective work: observe patterns, isolate causes, and prove the conclusion.

## Current Cases
- **Feature learning in the polynomial regime** (beyond the linear regime / random features).
- **Search algorithms for Boolean network ensembles** (mutation-set discovery & control of mis-pruning).
- **Optimal transport & statistics** (sample complexity, CLT, and practical tradeoffs).

## Methods & Tools
- **Theory:** probability, optimization, random matrices, learning theory.
- **Practice:** PyTorch, JAX (optional), Python tooling, reproducible experiments.
- **Writing:** LaTeX, TikZ, clean figures & ablations.

## Evidence Log (What I’m building)
- A clean experimental pipeline with readable configs, seeds, and plots.
- Notes that connect **intuition → lemma → theorem → experiment**.
- A public record of “failed leads” (negative results) when useful.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
